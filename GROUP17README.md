Grading Level: 
Same grade for all members.

Differences:
We hard-coded product information and pictures because there were no free APIs with the information that we needed. Also, due to complications with our application, we were not able to implement price comparison. This app will still help shoppers make shopping lists and allow them to see prices of products before going to the store. However, it will not be able to automatically compare prices.

Special Instructions:
The driving directions implementation on the map kept crashing the app so we commented out that part of the code as you requested.
